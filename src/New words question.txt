Number of New Words
Miss.Jane, an experienced English professor, gives practice tests to her students to improve their written skills. Everyday students write an article and they submit it to Jane. Jane is particular that the students use only special characters like , ; : . ? ! in the article.
She counts the total number of words used and the number of new words used by the students in the article. Based on the analysis done on the new words used by the students she gives her feedback to the students.
Jane finds it difficult when the number of students increase. So she wanted to automate the process in the following format. Help her to write a java program to display the new words using lower case and in alphabetical order.
